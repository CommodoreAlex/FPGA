## FPGA Design Workflow for Beginners

Designing a system on an FPGA involves several steps, but this workflow provides the **high-level steps** to prepare you for the hands-on projects that will help reinforce each stage.

Here is a video to expand on the ideas below:

### 1. High-Level Overview of FPGA Development

- **Writing Code (RTL Design)**: In this phase, you write **VHDL** (or Verilog) code that describes the behavior of the system you want to build. This code is how you tell the FPGA what to do.
- **Compilation and Synthesis**: Once you have the code, you need to check for errors and then **synthesize** it to convert your high-level VHDL code into a gate-level representation that the FPGA can understand.
- **Implementation**: After synthesis, the next step is **placement and routing**—which essentially means mapping the synthesized logic to the FPGA hardware.
- **Bitstream Generation and Programming**: Finally, you generate a **bitstream**, which is a file that contains all the configuration data needed to program the FPGA with your design.

### 2. Workflow in Context of Hands-On Projects

Rather than going into the technical details (like running specific tools), the workflow should give beginners a **big-picture view** of how the individual hands-on projects they’re doing fit into the overall FPGA development process.

For example:
- **Blinking LED Project**: In this project, you'll write VHDL to make the LED blink. This is the **first step** where you get comfortable with writing code and understanding how the FPGA hardware interacts with your design.
- **Button Debouncing Project**: For this project, you’ll learn how to handle noisy inputs, a crucial part of real-world FPGA designs. Here, the workflow will help you understand the broader need for input management.
- **Finite State Machine (FSM) Project**: By now, you'll dive into more complex logic, but the workflow ensures you understand how these projects connect to actual hardware and why steps like **synthesis** and **constraints** matter.

### 3. Why is the FPGA Design Workflow Important?

For complete beginners, the workflow provides context:

- **Prepares you mentally** for the steps you’ll encounter during each project.
- **Aligns theory with practice**: The workflow helps you understand why you’re performing each action (like generating a bitstream) instead of just doing it mechanically.
- **Prevents confusion**: Understanding the workflow means you’ll be less likely to get lost during the hands-on projects, as you’ll know the purpose behind each task.

### 4. How the Workflow Works with Projects

Rather than focusing on tool-specific commands or nitty-gritty details, the FPGA Design Workflow gives you a general **roadmap** for your FPGA journey:

- **Step 1 (Write VHDL Code)**: Understand that this is where you’ll **define your design’s logic**.
- **Step 2 (Synthesize the Design)**: Learn that this step ensures the FPGA **understands your code** and that there are no mistakes in logic.
- **Step 3 (Place and Route)**: At this point, you’ll see how the design **physically maps** to the FPGA hardware.
- **Step 4 (Generate the Bitstream and Program the FPGA)**: Finally, you’ll get hands-on experience by loading the design onto the FPGA to make it come alive.

Each of the **hands-on FPGA projects** you’ll work on will follow these general steps. The **FPGA Design Workflow** serves to clarify how the individual projects you’re working on connect to the broader FPGA development cycle. It's the "why" behind the "what" you’re doing in each project.
