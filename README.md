# Introduction to Embedded Systems Development with Xilinx FPGAs & VHDL

Welcome to **Embedded Systems with Xilinx FPGAs & VHDL for Beginners**.

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to mastering the fundamentals of **Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)** and **VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language)**. The focus is on embedded systems development, using Xilinx FPGAs as a platform to introduce practical FPGA design and development workflows. You'll gain hands-on experience with VHDL and FPGA architecture while building the foundational skills needed for advanced embedded system applications.

### Overview

This repository will help you:

- Understand the architecture and fundamentals of **Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)**, specifically using **Xilinx FPGA boards**.
- Learn the **VHDL** language to design and implement digital circuits on FPGAs.
- Set up a development environment for **Xilinx FPGAs** and get familiar with the tools required for FPGA design and simulation.
- Work through practical, hands-on projects to strengthen your understanding of FPGA-based embedded systems development.
- Bridge the gap between theoretical learning and real-world FPGA design by applying knowledge through simulations and physical hardware.

### Recommended Hardware & Costs

For my own embedded systems development journey using **Xilinx FPGAs** and **VHDL**, I invested in the following equipment:

1. [**Digilent Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA Trainer Board**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NUE1WOG?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
    - **Price**: $176.00
    - The **Basys 3** is an ideal starting point for beginners, offering a powerful platform for learning FPGA architecture and VHDL development.
2. [**Maeline 3ft Micro USB Cable**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q6HT22Q?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)
    - **Price**: $6.00
    - A critical accessory for connecting your FPGA board to your computer for programming and powering the board.

**Total Cost**: **$182.00**

This affordable setup provides a solid foundation for diving into FPGA and embedded systems development with hands-on learning.
